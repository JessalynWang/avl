Range Searching with AVL Trees
Jessalyn Wang, jwang456

--Description--
The lab contains an implmentation of an AVL tree. It allows for insertions and range queries.

--Files--
avl.h: header file for the AVL tree class

avl.cpp: file containing the functions in the AVL tree

wordrange.cpp: wrapper file that takes queries given by an input file and writes the appropriate results to an output file

Makefile: creates an executable, called wordrange, on running make

README: this file

--Usage--
On running make, an executable named wordrange is created. Run ./wordrange <input file> <output file>. The input file should contain commands in the form of <command> <value>. Wordrange supports insertion and range commands. Insertion should be formatted as i <value to be inserted>, while range should be formatted as r <value1> <value2> where value1 is less than value2. Wordrange writes the result of all range commands to the output file.
